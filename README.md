# A very simple SFML starter (using cmake)

This is a basic example for `SFML` similar to what `raylib` provides on their
`README.md`. It creates a window and draws the text `"Congrats! You created your
first SFML window!"` in the middle of the screen.

Using the `cmake` workflow to compile is optional, you only need to properly
link to `sfml`.

Here is the code from `main.cpp`:
```cpp
```

## Compiling and running
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make && ./hello_sfml
```
